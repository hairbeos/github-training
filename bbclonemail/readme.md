BBCloneMail: An Experiment With MarionetteJS

**NOTE:** This code is currently in an experimental state. I don't recommend 
using it as guidance for how to build Marionette apps at the moment. If you
would like to see a better reference code base, check out the version of
BBCloneMail that [Foxandxss is building](https://github.com/Foxandxss/bbclonemail).

## See It In Action

This is a sample application, demonstrating how to use my 
[Backbone.Marionette](http://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette)
plugin for Backbone.js. You can see it in action at:

http://bbclonemail.heroku.com

## Running BBCloneMail On Your Computer

BBCloneMail is a NodeJS app built on Express.js. To run it on your
computer you'll want to clone this repository to your machine somewhere,
and then follow these steps:

1. Install the latest http://nodejs.org if you don't have it already
2. Open a command prompt / terminal window in the BBCloneMail project folder
3. Run `npm install` to install all of the needed components
4. Run `npm start` to start the server
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

Note that step 1 through 3 only have to be done once. After you have
done that, you just need to run step 4 and 5 any time you want to
see the app running on your computer.

## A Work In Progress

Keep in mind that this is always a work in progress. While the source code
and functionality do demonstrate all of the core features and capabilities
of Backbone.Marionette, the application itself is very limited in it's 
functionality. 

Also note that I haven't optimized the JavaScript downloads in any way. There
is no minification, and no asset packaging to create a single download for the
entire application at this point. As a result, the app takes a moment or two
to download all of the JavaScript files and start up.

As I continue working on functionality, I'll also put in some optimizations for
the JavaScript, so that it starts up faster.
